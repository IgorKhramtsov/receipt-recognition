To test out ideas simply copy this code into a new Test_<something> directory

Edit Process.cpp with whatever you're doing

make and 

./main.exe -i <file or dir>
./main.exe -r -k <msec> -i <dir for recursive processing>

The rest of the code delivers the command line controls of the skinview app

The fully recursive feature -r will walk the tree from the root directory
specifice with -i
